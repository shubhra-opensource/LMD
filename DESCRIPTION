Description: Local Mean Decomposition (LMD), an iterative approach to demodulating amplitude and frequency modulated signals. The method decomposes signals into a set of functions, each of which is the product of an envelope signal and a frequency modulated signal from which a time-varying instantaneous frequency can be derived. The LMD method can be used to analyze a wide variety of natural signals such as electrocardiograms, functional magnetic resonance imaging data, and earthquake data. The package is based on <“PyLMD: Jonathan S. Smith. The local mean decomposition and its application to EEG perception data. Journal of the Royal Society Interface, 2005, 2(5): 443-454.” Accessed: Sep. 10, 2022. Available: (<https://github.com/shownlin/PyLMD>) .
