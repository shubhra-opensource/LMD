**A Self-Adaptive Approach for Demodulating Multi-Component Signal**

_Local Mean Decomposition (LMD)_ is an iterative and self-adaptive approach for demodulating, processing, and analyzing multi-component amplitude modulated and frequency modulated signals.  

This R package is based on the approach suggested by **Smith (2005)** [doi:10.1098/rsif.2005.0058] and the Python library **PyLMD**.
