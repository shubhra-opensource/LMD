# LMD

A Self-Adaptive Approach for Demodulating Multi-Component Signal

Local Mean Decomposition is an iterative and self-adaptive approach for demodulating, processing, and analyzing multi-component amplitude modulated and frequency modulated signals. This R package is based on the approach suggested by Smith (2005) \<doi:10.1098/rsif.2005.0058\> and the 'Python' library 'PyLMD'.
